[Our group](https://acn.ugr.es) at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es) (Spain) is looking for a talented and motivated PhD student interested in working in the field of robotics virtualization.

## Research topic

Remote handling (RH) technologies represent a critical piece in those environments where human intervention is forbidden. In particular, the presence of human operators in contaminated/activated areas is highly constrained, due to the serious consequences that exposition may have in the operators’ health. Thus, challenging environments require the use of specific tools and devices to support inspection, diagnose, maintenance and reparation tasks.

Digital simulation in virtual reality environments is today a common practise for the design of assembly and maintenance processes. Identification of critical paths in the RH operations to be performed helps the designer, among the other things, in the selection of optimised procedures and in the estimation of the total duration of the processes under evaluation. Indeed, simulation of the virtual RH tasks allows the validation of the different tasks, asses their feasibility and optimise the RH resources required before the infrastructure is built. In addition to this, the simulations need to be dynamic and interactive towards early detection of potential problems in RH tasks, performance estimation, feasibility assessment and RH operators’ training.

The candidates will be working in the framework of the international [EuroFUSION](https://www.euro-fusion.org/) initiative where he/she will be in charge of developing virtual reality systems to simulate RH tasks in the [IFMIF-DONES](http://www.fusion.ciemat.es/international-projects/ifmif/) facility. The successful candidate will implement, as part of a doctorate program, a workflow from computer-assisted designs (CAD) towards virtual reality environments with video-game physical engines.

## Requirements

Two different profiles will be considered for this position: (i) a graduated (e.g. computer science although other degrees can be considered) with proven expertise in Unity 3D game development and strong programming skills or (ii) an industrial engineer with proven expertise on using relevant CAD tools for engineering processes simulation (e.g. CATIA/DELMIA, 3D Studio, Solidworks, …).
For any of the mentioned profiles, the following skills will be highly valued:

* Expertise on creation of virtual environments with Unity3D or other similar physical engines.
* Knowledge of CAD tools for engineering design and simulation.
* Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, C++, C#...).
* Proficiency in English.

## What do we offer?

* The successful candidate will join our young and multidisciplinary [ACN](https://acn.ugr.es) research group at the [CITIC-UGR](https://citic.ugr.es/) (in Granada), a top-ranked research centre.
* He/She will obtain a one-year fellowship, and extendable up to four years, pursuing a joint doctorate between the [University of Granada](https://acn.ugr.es) and the [CIEMAT](http://www.ciemat.es/portal.do).
* He/She will gain expertise in RH virtualization at the [IFMIF-DONES](http://www.fusion.ciemat.es/international-projects/ifmif/) facility.

## How to apply?

Candidates should send a single pdf file, consisting of a 1-page motivation letter and CV to <jesusgarrido@ugr.es>. Any informal enquiries can be addressed to the same email. The position will be open until filled.
