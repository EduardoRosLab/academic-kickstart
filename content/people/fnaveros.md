![Francisco Naveros](/img/fnaveros.jpg)

I received my M.S in Telecomunication Engineering from the University of Granada (Spain) in 2011. In December 2011 I officially joined to the University of Granada with a National Grant as a researcher of the European Project TOMSY. I also received my M.S. in Computer Architecture and Networks from the University of Granada in 2012. Finally, I received my Doctorate from the University of Granada in 2017 in Computational neuroscience. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Computational Neuroscience and Neurorobotics Lab of the University of Granada.

From 2012 to 2014, I participated in an EU project related to adaptive learning mechanisms and bio-inspired control REALNET. From 2014 to the present, I have been participating in the Human Brain Project (HBP); a ten-year, large-scale European research initiative whose goal is to better understand the human brain and its diseases and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities. In 2016 I moved to Dr. Arleo's lab in Paris for a period of six months.
 
My research interests include the simulation of spiking neural networks in real-time for embodiment experiments. More concretely, I am interested in the cerebellum, a small brain centre tighly related with the coordination of movements. Our research group has developed a cerebelar model able to perform embodiment experiments with simulated and real robots in real-time, mimicking the way the brain controls our bodies. This kind of embodiment experiments require from specializes tools able to perform the whole simulation in real-time. During my PhD degree I have been focussed in the developmen of EDLUT, a spiking neural network simulator integrating event-driven and time-driven computation schemes using parallel CPU-GPU co-processing. This simulator has been specially designed to perform embodiment experiments in real-time.
